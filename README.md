# sftp sync extension for VS Code

Maintained by [@z-z](https://github.com/z-z) <br>
(Forked from [@Natizyskunk's SFTP plugin](https://github.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp), which itself was originally forked from [liximomo's SFTP plugin](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-sftp.git))

- VS Code marketplace : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zaur.sftp <br>
- VSIX release : https://github.com/z-z/vscode-sftp/releases/

## History
_The notes below are carried over from [@Natizyskunk's fork](https://github.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp), the repository this project is forked from, and are kept here for attribution/context._

### INFOS - 2023/06/23
This was the main repository for the SFTP extension since [@liximomo](https://github.com/liximomo) had set his own to deprecated in favor of this one in the VSCode marketplace.
There are also other forks that are available. Feel free to try them.

A lot of work as been brought to fix bugs, add new features and more than 50 updates have been released with a lot of improvements and stability fixes for almost two years now. 😎

At the start of the year 2023, a new fork from [@satiromarra](https://github.com/satiromarra) was born with some really cool features. So for the future we decided to work together and put our efforts in one place to make an even better extension for the community.

As of today (2023-06-23) we'll now be two collaborators : [@satiromarra](https://github.com/satiromarra) and [@me](https://github.com/Natizyskunk) 🙂.

We've been working hard to fix a lot of things and we've updated more than 50 new releases with a lot of improvements and stability fixes and we've brought new features for almost two years now. 

We'll try to keep this extension up-to-date as much as we can and add new relevant features. For the last 6 months I wasn't able to work a lot on the project because of personal reasons at the time so I'm glad [@satiromarra](https://github.com/satiromarra) was able to take on while I wasn't here.

Also we would be more than happy to have you participate in one way or another to this project. You can do so by simply following the [templates](https://github.com/z-z/vscode-sftp/issues/new/choose) when you open a new issue or a new pull request.

VSCode-SFTP enables you to add, edit or delete files within a local directory and have it sync to a remote server directory using different transfer protocols like FTP or SSH. The most basic setup requires only a few lines of configuration with a wide array of specific settings also available to meet the needs of any user. Both powerful and fast, it helps developers save time by allowing the use of a familiar editor and environment.

## Usage
If the latest files are already on a remote server, you can start with an empty local folder,
then download your project, and from that point sync.

1. In `VS Code`, open a local directory you wish to sync to the remote server (or create an empty directory
that you wish to first download the contents of a remote server folder in order to edit locally).
2. `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac open command palette, run `SFTP: config` command.
3. A basic configuration file will appear named `sftp.json` under the `.vscode` directory, open and edit the configuration parameters with your remote server information.

For instance:
```json
{
    "name": "Profile Name",
    "host": "name_of_remote_host",
    "protocol": "ftp",
    "port": 21,
    "secure": true,
    "username": "username",
    "remotePath": "/public_html/project", // <--- This is the path which will be downloaded if you "Download Project"
    "password": "password",
    "uploadOnSave": false
}
```
The password parameter in `sftp.json` is optional, if left out you will be prompted for a password on sync.
_Note：_ backslashes and other special characters must be escaped with a backslash.

4. Save and close the `sftp.json` file.
5. `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac open command palette.
6. Type `sftp` and you'll now see a number of other commands. You can also access many of the commands from the project's file explorer context menus.
7. A good one to start with if you want to sync with a remote folder is `SFTP: Download Project`.  This will download the directory shown in the `remotePath` setting in `sftp.json` to your local open directory.
8. Done - you can now edit locally and after each save it will upload to sync your remote file with the local copy.
9. Enjoy!

### Simple
```json
{
  "host": "host",
  "username": "username",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace"
}
```

### Profiles
```json
{
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace/a",
  "watcher": {
    "files": "dist/*.{js,css}",
    "autoUpload": false,
    "autoDelete": false
  },
  "profiles": {
    "dev": {
      "host": "dev-host",
      "remotePath": "/dev",
      "uploadOnSave": true
    },
    "prod": {
      "host": "prod-host",
      "remotePath": "/prod"
    }
  },
  "defaultProfile": "dev"
}
```

_Note：_ `context` and `watcher` are only available at root level.

Use `SFTP: Set Profile` to switch profile.

### Multiple Context
The context must **not be same**.
```json
[
  {
    "name": "server1",
    "context": "project/build",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/build"
  },
  {
    "name": "server2",
    "context": "project/src",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/src"
  }
]
```

_Note：_ `name` is required in this mode.

### Connection Hopping
You can connect to a target server through a proxy with ssh protocol.

_Note：_ Variable substitution is not working in a hop configuration.

#### Single Hop
local -> hop -> target
```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  // hop
  "host": "hopHost",
  "username": "hopUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/localUser/.ssh/id_rsa", // <-- The key file is assumed on the local.

  "hop": {
    // target
    "host": "targetHost",
    "username": "targetUsername",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopUser/.ssh/id_rsa", // <-- The key file is assumed on the hop.
  }
}
```

#### Multiple Hop
local -> hopa -> hopb -> target
```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  // hopa
  "host": "hopAHost",
  "username": "hopAUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopAUsername/.ssh/id_rsa" // <-- The key file is assumed on the local.

  "hop": [
    // hopb
    {
      "host": "hopBHost",
      "username": "hopBUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopaUser/.ssh/id_rsa" // <-- The key file is assumed on the hopa.
    },

    // target
    {
      "host": "targetHost",
      "username": "targetUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopbUser/.ssh/id_rsa", // <-- The key file is assumed on the hopb.
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration in User Setting
You can use `remote` to tell sftp to get the configuration from [remote-fs](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-remote-fs).

In User Setting:
```json
"remotefs.remote": {
  "dev": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "rootPath": "/path/to/somewhere"
  },
  "projectX": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/xx/.ssh/id_rsa",
    "rootPath": "/home/foo/some/projectx"
  }
}
```

In sftp.json:
```json
{
  "remote": "dev",
  "remotePath": "/home/xx/",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "ignore": [".vscode", ".git", ".DS_Store"]
}
```

## Remote Explorer
![remote-explorer-preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-z/vscode-sftp/master/assets/showcase/remote-explorer.png)

Remote Explorer lets you explore files in remote. You can open Remote Explorer by:

1. Run Command `View: Show SFTP`.
2. Click SFTP view in Activity Bar.

You can only view a files content with Remote Explorer. Run command `SFTP: Edit in Local` to edit it in local.

### Multiple Select
You are able to select multiple files/folders at once on the remote server to download and upload. You can do it simply by holding down Ctrl or Shift while selecting all desired files, just like on the regular explorer view.

_Note：_ You need to manually refresh the parent folder after you **delete** a file if the explorer isn't correctly updated.

### Order
You can order the remote Explorer by adding the `remoteExplorer.order` parameter inside your `sftp.json` config file.

In sftp.json:
```json
{
  "remoteExplorer": {
    "order": 1 // <-- Default value is 0.
  }
}
```

## Debug
1. Open User Settings.
  - On Windows/Linux - `File > Preferences > Settings`
  - On macOS - `Code > Preferences > Settings`
2. Set `sftp.debug` to `true` and reload vscode.
3. View the logs in `View > Output > sftp`.
